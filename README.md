#Node/Express 2

- Remember, assessments are meant to be completed by you, not as a shared exercise with friends or other members of your cohort.   
- All code submitted should be written by you. If you incorporate code from elsewhere, it must be clearly specified.

### Part 1: Conceptual
Answer the following questions inside the conceptual.md file.

### Part 2: Timeword.js
##### Solve the following problem in JavaScript:
- Turn a string of 24h time into words.
- You can trust that you’ll be given a valid string (it will always have a two-digit hour 00-23, and a two-digit minute 00-59). Hours 0-11 are am, and hours 12-23 are pm.
- Examples of the output we’d like:  
`Input: 00:00
Expected Output: midnight`  
`Input: 00:12
Expected Output: twelve twelve am`

- Write tests for these cases and make sure your code passes these.
- Also, do this without the aid of any external packages. The goal here is to have you think about how you’d solve the problem, not have you show us how good you are at finding third-party libraries.

### Part 3: Buggy App

***You’ve just joined a team that is building a web app for a financial system, bankly.
You have a generally-nicely-written application and it even has tests, and all tests pass!
However, there are several bugs in the application — they’re just not things that are being tested for (so, in a sense, there are two bugs for each: the broken code, and the fact that there’s no test that caught it).
Some bugs relate to methods returning slightly-wrong information, or being too flexible in what they accept, or failing to check reasonable security requirements.***  

----------

#####Get the App Running   


First step is to get everything running. We’ve made the commands easy for you:

`cd bankly`  
`npm install`  
`npm run seed # sets up the regular and test databases`  
`npm test  # runs jest`  
`npm start  # runs server w/ 'node'; feel free to change to nodemon`  
​
##### Strategies
- Read the docstrings for the routes carefully. Treat these as your “source of truth” for what the function is supposed to do.
- Look at what tests are provided, and think about whether these tests are strict enough to sufficiently test what the function needs to do. Think about what tests are missing that could catch these bugs.


##### Goals
We’ve put in six bugs (it’s possible that there are other, unintentional bugs, too).
Be mindful of the definition of a bug. If this application is missing a feature or something that would be “nice to have” - that does not mean it’s a bug. Please only include things that certainly lead to errors or security issues in our application.
You don’t need to find all six — but do the best you can!  


##### What You Should Submit For This
You should turn in:  

- A short description of the bug in `bugs.md`  
- A test that catches that case (put in a comment, eg // TESTS BUG #1, so we can find it)
- A fix for the code (put in a comment, eg // FIXES BUG #1, so we can find it)
